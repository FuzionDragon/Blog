# David L's Blog

Welcome to my blog website, a place where I semi-regularly post about what I'm up to.

I will occasionally write up on whatever projects I am working with, technologies I am trying out and more.

Every blog page on this website, including this one, is written in markdown and delivered using a router using Markedjs as a backbone.
